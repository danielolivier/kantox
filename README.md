Project built using [EmberJS](https://guides.emberjs.com/release/)
Desgined following design requirements established in Figma file

## Running / Development

- `ember serve`
- Visit your app at [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200).
- Visit your tests at [http://localhost:4200/tests](http://localhost:4200/tests).

## Description

Project follows logic explained in Github README.md file and design from Figma file. In addition ember-heroicons has been added to help deal with icon addition into project. App is quite simple as it centers all state management to service/checkout.js and from there with extra help from helpers it shows desired information into different components.

Application redirects to /products - as I didn't see the point in having a "home" path - and if clicks in the shopping cart icon it leads to /checkout path where there's the summary of the shopping cart.
